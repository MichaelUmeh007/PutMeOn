# PutMeOn
- minimalist gui spotify song recommder
- after setting SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, and SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI environment variables using info from app dashbaord at developer.spotify.com
- you execute the app.py file and the application starts, you click the "put me on" button and a list of song recommedations is offered
- very simple, my first foray into apis, i hope to make it much more complex and effective in the future, with more experience
